# imanin

We want to get to an interactive manim in svelte.
As a litmus test we want to port dlx_3x2_three_tiles.py

In this repo we don't try to get a studio.

## Run from repo root

You can run the app scripts from the repository root:

- `bun run dev` (proxies to `app/`)
- `bun run build`
- `bun run check`
- `bun run test:e2e`

No special install/setup step is needed for the DLX animation route.

## Routes

- `/dlx`: DLX animation route (interactive 2x2 matrix preview).
- `/scenes/<script>/<scene>`: feature-sweep routes covering the broader
  Manim-to-Svelte scene set.

## Plans (chronological)

1. [PLAN.md](PLAN.md)
